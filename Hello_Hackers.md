# Intro to Commands
### Tought me what commands are, and how they are called/invoked
Nothing much to explain how I solved - just passed the command to linux terminal by typing it and pressing enter

# Intro to Arguments
### What I understood: Arguments are basically details that we give along with a command, so as to get the desired result based on the details we give.
> [!NOTE]
> The details (arguments) we give (pass) directly affect the results we get

# Command History
### Tought me how to toggle between my previous commands passed
> [!TIP]
> Toggling between commands with arrow keys makes it a lot easier to edit the commands and pass them again
