### Challenge 3: More catting practice

**Commands + Output:**
```bash
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cd
You used 'cd'! In this level, I don't allow you to change the working directory 
--- you MUST chase pass 'cat' the absolute path of where I put it on the 
filesystem (which is /usr/share/vim/flag).
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /usr/share/vim/flag
pwn.college{QkhCjnUl0sMYqVr8lb0mIiPKatd.QXwITO0wCMwAzNzEzW}
```

**Flag:**
pwn.college{QkhCjnUl0sMYqVr8lb0mIiPKatd.QXwITO0wCMwAzNzEzW}
