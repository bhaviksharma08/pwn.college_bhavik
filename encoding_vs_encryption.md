# Encoding vs Encryption
Both are processes of converting data from one form to another, but they differ in:
1. Purpose of conversion
2. Access

1. Encoding is about converting data into a different form for transmission, storage or compatibility purpose. It is not about secrecy.
2. Encoded data can be interconverted by any set of people who know the algorithm used for the interconversion, whereas encrypted data cannot be converted back to the original form if you don't have the correct key for decoding. Data is encrypted so that it is only readable to the correct set of people, whom the data is meant for. Such people are provided with a key for decoding at their device.
